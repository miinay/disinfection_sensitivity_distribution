# disinfection_sensitivity_dist

# What is this page?
This page contains the R script to estimate disinfectant sensitivity distributions using a Bayesian framework.

# Objective
Disinfection efficacy against viruses has been extensively studied. By integrating reported experimental data on inactivation rate constants for various viruses, we propose a statistical framework to analyze variation in viral sensitivity to disinfectants through a Bayesian approach. This R code constructs parametric disinfectant sensitivity distributions for three disinfectants: ultraviolet, ozone, and free chlorine.
